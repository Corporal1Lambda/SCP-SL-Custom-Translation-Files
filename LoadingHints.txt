There are four main zones in the Facility: <color=#f5eb9c>Light Containment</color>, <color=#ca2642>Heavy Containment</color>, <color=#bcfab2>Entrance</color>, and <color=#9cc7f5>Surface<color>.
<color=#FFFF7C>Scientists</color> and <color=#FF8E00>Class-D</color> must reach the <color=#9cc7f5>Surface<color> to escape.
<color=#5B6370>Facility Guards</color> are weak alone but have strength in numbers. Stick together!
Your stamina is a precious resource, reserve some for emergencies!
The <color=#bcfab2>Entrance Zone</color> has two gates that provide access to the <color=#9cc7f5>Surface<color>. You'll need a keycard to open them.
Using an elevator is a quick and easy way to escape most SCPs.
Escaped <color=#FF8E00>Class-D</color> join the <color=#008F1C>Chaos Insurgency</color>, while escaped <color=#FFFF7C>Scientists</color> become <color=#0096FF>MTF</color>.
<color=#FFFF7C>Adrenaline</color> can be used to instantly refresh your stamina and gives you an advantage in combat.
<color=#5B6370>Radios</color> have four range settings. The longer the range, the faster the battery drains.
<color=#f5650a>Tesla gates</color> are electric hazards found throughout the <color=#ca2642>Heavy Containment Zone</color>. Proceed with caution!
<color=#0096FF>Mobile Task Force</color> units and <color=#008F1C>Chaos Insurgents</color> arrive at opposite ends of the <color=#9cc7f5>Surface Zone<color>.
The <color=red>Alpha Warhead</color> kills anything inside the Facility when it detonates. It can be activated from the <color=#9cc7f5>Surface Zone<color>.
The <color=red>Alpha Warhead</color> detonation sequence can be canceled from its room in <color=#ca2642>Heavy Containment</color>.
The Intercom room in the Entrance Zone can be used to broadcast a voice message to all players.
You can throw items (‘T’ by default). This can be used to open keycard doors from a distance or to break glass.
The <color=#f5eb9c>Light Containment Zone</color> will lock down after 15 minutes; killing anyone left inside. Escape while you can!
Maximize your advantage by adjusting your weapon attachments based on the situation you find yourself in.
The more attachments a weapon has on it, the heavier it gets. This affects stamina usage and movement speed.
Not only do suppressors muffle gunshots, they also hide muzzle flashes.
Longer and heavier weapons are less accurate if fired while running.
Wearing body armor increases the number of items and ammo you can carry.
Armor-piercing rounds (AP) perform best against armored targets.
Hollow-point rounds (JHP) do higher damage to unarmored targets but are weaker against armor.

<color=#0096FF>Grenades</color> can be thrown with less force using the right mouse button.
The <color=#003DCA>Micro H.I.D.</color> can kill most SCPs very quickly but has a limited power supply. Use it wisely!
The <color=#003DCA>Micro H.I.D.</color> requires about five seconds of charging before it can fire.
Holding right mouse button will keep the <color=#003DCA>Micro H.I.D.</color> at its ready-to-fire state; slowly draining energy.
The <color=#003DCA>Micro H.I.D.</color> is very loud while charging. Make sure to use it while your targets can’t run away.
Charging the <color=#003DCA>Micro H.I.D.</color> produces an intimidating sound which is enough to ruin your enemies' plans.
A bottle of <color=red>SCP-207</color> not only increases your movement speed, but will partially restore your health as well.
Up to four <color=red>SCP-207</color> bottles can be consumed, allowing for a significant multiplier to your speed.
<color=red>SCP-500</color> not only heals you but removes most negative effects, and provides regeneration afterwards.

<color=red>SCP-268</color> won’t save you from <color=red>SCP-096</color> if you’ve looked at him.

<color=red>SCP-914</color> can change all items, including weapons and ammunition.
<color=red>SCP-914</color> can recharge <color=#5B6370>radios</color> and the <color=#003DCA>Micro H.I.D.</color>
<color=red>SCP-914</color> can create a number of unique items that can’t be found anywhere else. Feel free to experiment!

While in Stalk, <color=red>SCP-106</color> can see humans in a short radius around him.
<color=red>SCP-106</color> can open up a map of nearby rooms to teleport to, bound to ‘TAB’ by default.

<color=red>SCP-939</color> can release a cloud of amnestic gas. Humans under its effects cannot perceive <color=red>SCP-939</color> until it attacks.
Using <color=#FFFF7C>adrenaline</color> negates the effects of <color=red>SCP-939</color>’s amnestic cloud.
Flashbangs are especially effective against <color=red>SCP-939</color>.
The lower <color=red>SCP-939</color>’s stamina is, the poorer its perception of players becomes.
The longer <color=red>SCP-939</color> is in Focus, the more effective Ultrasensitive becomes.
