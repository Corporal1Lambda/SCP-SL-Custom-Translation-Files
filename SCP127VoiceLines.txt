Ow! <pause> Dammit, that hurts!
Ugh... <pause> I'll feel that tomorrow.
Urgh...
Aagh... <pause> Uhh..
Uuurgh...
Aagh...
Ahh! <pause> Urgh... I hate that part!
Nope... <pause> Never gettin’ any better... <pause> Ahh...
Ahh! Urgh... <pause> That stings!
Drowning constantly is one thing... <pause> But these guys? <pause> \n I don't want what they have in store.
Listen to me. <pause> They're bad business! <pause> I don't trust 'em.
No... <pause> Not here! <pause> Not again!
Long ago... <pause> it used to not just be me underwater.
Them again?
This... isn't gonna end well...
Good to see ya!
Hello again!
Hello there!
Hello!
Hey, hey!
How's it goin'?
Don't forget about me!
Guess I'll wait here!
Oh, no... You go on ahead! <pause> I'll catch up...
See ya later, boss!
Ay, take care, boss!
Hey! Watch the paint!
I'll be here if you need me!
Bye-bye!
Fair enough!
Goodbye!
Is the safety on? <pause> Nah, just kiddin'!
Is the safety on?
Off I go!
You know where to find me, boss!
I know a great bar down in Queens, first round’s on you! <pause> \n ..  On account of me not ownin’ any cash. 
Y'know... <pause> I was in a completely different facility at one point! <pause> Mmm... That's right! <pause> \n There was a bit o’ rumblin’ here, <pause> a few explosions there, <pause> and the next thing you know... I'm here now! <pause> \n Wonder what happened to the rest of the guys locked up there. <pause> Hope they got out all right...
I'm gettin' paid for this... <pause> right?
Oh! Did you hear that? <pause> Sounded like death! <pause> \n Someone died... <pause> Something to that effect. <pause> Tend to hear that a lot around here. <pause> \n Now that I think about it... <pause> the whole place just... echoes with death!
Aaaaaagh! Oh, shh... <pause> Sorry, boss! <pause> \n I thought I heard somethin'- <pause> Wait! <pause> Nope, nothin'.
Lemme tell ya. <pause> This place is an absolute mess right now! <pause> \n Looks so secure, too! <pause> What went wrong...?
Hey, boss! <pause> You got any plans for when you get out of here?
Hey, uh... question, boss! <pause> You don't have to answer if you don't wanna, \n but uh... <pause> are you sure you know where we're goin'? <pause> I swear we've seen this hallway before.
Umm, you... <pause> you almost hit somethin'!
I like your style, boss!
That invisible hat fella around?
Uhhh... <pause> you good, boss?
Aha! Reinforcements!
Don't let them take me again!
Don't say anything! Ask for a lawyer!
Friends of yours?
A’ight, I got a plan! <pause> \n Well, no... that's a lie... <pause> But I'm workin' on it!
Oh... That- ...that's not good, is it?
Oh... Things are getting interestin' now...
Oho! Looks like we're getting backup!
Bang!
Beat it!
Good one, boss!
Ay, good stuff!
Good work, boss!
Nice one, boss!
Hey! Nice shot!
Whoa-ho! Nice!
Rattle 'im!
Scram!
Whamo!
Ahem... Seriously? <pause> Neck-snap McGee gets a cell? And I get drowned?
(coughing) <pause> ...Pleased to meet ya! <pause> They call me one-twenny-seven around these parts.
Ahh! You got room for one more? <pause> (coughing)
(coughing) <pause> ...Say, what year is it?
Ahh! Oh, sweet oxygen! <pause> I missed ya!
Wrrghh... you call that waterboarding? <pause> Do your worst!
Gas mask? <pause> I like your style, pal!
Sick glad rags, boss!
You, uh... <pause> You fellas from outta town?
What’s a couple’ a’ corpses for freedom, eh boss?
Hey, chief! <pause> Need a hand in breaking out?
A’ight, you and I? <pause> Partners in crime!
From one internee, to another... <pause> Let's tag 'em, boss!
Hey! I used to own a jumpsuit like that!
Woah! Break-out!
Ah! <pause> Easy on the grip, boss!
Hey, boss! How's it going?
(sobbing)
Hey, boss! Take me with!
Any chance I can go... <pause> when this is over? <pause> No? <pause> Okay...
Ah, jeez! We can be friends... <pause> aye, boss?
Didn't you stick me in that tank last week?
Those glasses better be prescription!
You do know how to shoot, right? <pause> N-no offense, boss... just checkin'...
Hey, you here to rescue me? Ha-ha-ha!
I'll be honest... <pause> I think you're a bit out of place here, boss!
I'll be honest... <pause> This' goin' way better than expected!
Hey, boss! <pause> I'd say we're doin' pretty good!
Oh! It feels good to be back!
Dis’ is gettin’ nuts...  <pause> I think we're winnin'!
(manic laughter, followed by pain)
Look at us go! Partners in crime! <pause> Or justice... if that's how you swing...
Hah! An apple a day, aye boss?
Whatever's behind that beak, <pause> I'm glad we never had to see it!
I AM THE BLACK DEATH!
Consider Ms. Birdface a widow, doc!
Overdosed on shells! <pause> That's a new one, aye boss?
Resurrect this!
No worries! <pause> We'll take good care of the kids!
0101, moron!
Ain't ever dyin' to a mini-fridge!
Yeah... Keep the camera to yourself, creep!
Never liked that toaster!
I hope his warranty hasn't run out.
Seven feet tall? <pause> Seven foot fall!
You had a good run, buddy! <pause> Your face was all the rage!
I may not have eyes, <pause> but you're one ugly bastard!
I may not have eyes, <pause> but I know you're one ugly bastard!
I always liked the statue more!
Finally! <pause> I thought he'd never shut up!
Have fun in the cage!
Alright, you can stop checking over your shoulder now, boss! <pause> Old dude's gone!
Yeah! Pocket this dimension, you grease ball!
Thank god! No more of that terrible sinkin’ feelin'!
You created your own hell, <pause> why don't you stay for a bit?
Sunk into the floor like he had cement shoes!
Well... I'm sure your death was an experience. <pause> A real eye-opener, even!
Try to piece THAT back together!
Oh, good! That scrapin' was gettin' on my nerves!
Ah! Shattered like glass!
What? Nothing to say now?
Stay down, freakshow!
You ain’t the first ventriloquist I’ve iced!
You ain’t the first ventriloquist I’ve iced!
You don't got no more bones you can pick with us! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's one less skeleton in the closet!
We got the Skinwalker, boss!
All those freaky powers, and you ain't even bullet-proof?
Billions of dollars to build this place! <pause> And all you needed was a couple of rounds?
Gun beats, uh... <pause> Whatever you are!
Gun beats, the... <pause> Whatever you are!
Not so tough now, are ya?
Why build a container when you can use a gun?!
Ain't no pill that can fix you, fella! <pause> Except... the uhh... <pause> whatever.
Yeah! Get his goons, boss!
Well... if it isn't Mr. Twelve Feet Under!
Say goodbye to your goons, doc!
And stay down, you disease!
You got two lives too many, fellas!
What gets up, must fall back down, eh?
No! <pause> I have attachment issues!
Boss...? <pause> Boss?! <pause> BOSS!!!
Hey, hey! <pause> GET UP!
I was just starting to like you!
No... <pause> no, c'mon! <pause> NOT NOW!
No... <pause> no, c'mon! <pause> Not now...
Not again, not again, not again!
Not again?!
