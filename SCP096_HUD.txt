SCP-096 starts docile, and can become enraged when someone sees its face, or harms it. Rage empowers with many abilities, which assist SCP-096 in following transgressor’s lights before the fury subsides.
Try Not to Cry:It's hard to go on… but leaning on something helps you to calm down, either to hide… or to wait for someone to come by.
Melee Attack:Tear through anything in your way to get to those who've hurt you. Your attacks will destroy doors and injure humans.
Charge:Cut their escapes short — they deserve it. You bolt straight ahead for a short distance, demolishing anything in your path.
