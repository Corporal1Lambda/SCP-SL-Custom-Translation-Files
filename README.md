# SCP-SL-Custom-Translation-Files
Custom translation files for SCP: Secret Laboratory

These translation files are intended to enhance the original ones we got from Northwood Studios.
They are mostly custom but I did took inspiration from other people.

⚠️Expect memes and unfunny jokes inside⚠️


Right click SL in your steam library, then go to "Manage" section, click "Browse local files", now go to the "Translations" folder and find folder of the language that
you are using, then replace all the files in that folder with my custom ones.
You can also create new folder in there and dump all those files in there, but make sure to change the language in the game settings!

Also if you have any suggestions just idk, text me on discord or smh -Corporal Lambda-#6948, if I will like something I might add it.
