ATTACK COOLDOWN
Unavailable on this level.
Unavailable during elevator travel.
Work together with your <color=#F00>SCP teammates</color>. Use your teleportation abilities to quickly catch up to prey or escape from dangerous situations.
Capture:Press [key] on a nearby human to deal damage and inflict them with Corroding, draining their health. If the victim is already suffering from Corroding, this attack will send them to your Pocket Dimension.
Stalk:Press [key] to sink into the floor and regenerate Hume Shield. When in Stalk, you are unable to attack, move faster, and see humans above you within a short range. Stalk drains Vigor over time, and pressing [key] again will manually exit Stalk.
Hunter’s Atlas:Hold [key] to open up a small map of your surroundings. Press LMB while hovering over a point on the map to quickly teleport there and cut off your prey. You gain a short speed boost upon teleporting.
Blissful Agony:Your abilities rely on a resource named Vigor, visible above your health and Hume Shield meter. Vigor regenerates while moving and when you capture humans.
