Work together with your <color=#F00>SCP teammates</color>. You have a high health pool but cannot move if observed. While observed, use your blink ability to teleport onto humans, snapping their necks and instantly killing them.
Breakneck Speeds:Press [key] to move faster, blink quicker, and gain a longer blink distance. You cannot kill when the ability is active. Use this ability to catch up to far away humans or act as an effective scout.
Blink:You can only move when unobserved or when humans blink. While looked at, an eye with a counter appears in the center of your display. Once the counter reaches zero, you may hold and then release [key] to teleport. Teleporting on top of a human instantly kills them.
Reinforced Concrete:Your concrete body is highly armored, causing lower-penetration firearms to deal significantly reduced damage to your permanent health pool.
Tantrum:While unobserved, press [key] to excrete a pool of filth onto the floor. Humans that step into this pool will be Stained, slowing their movement and causing them to produce loud footsteps. Killing Stained players regenerates some Hume Shield.
