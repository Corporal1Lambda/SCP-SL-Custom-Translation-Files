Choke~Increases total radius of spread but improves the consistency of the pattern.
Extended Barrel~Slightly reduces the spread radius but increases the total firearm weight and length.
No Stock~Short configurations come with high mobility, but removing stocks from a high-recoil rifle isn't always the best idea.
